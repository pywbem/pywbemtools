Development: The pywbem version during development now uses an automatically
calculated dev number and the git commit hash, e.g. '1.4.0a1.dev9+gad875911'.
The pywbem version numbers for packages released to Pypi are unchanged: 'M.N.U'.
Updated the release description in DEVELOP.md to no longer edit the version
file.
