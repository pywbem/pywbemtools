Refactored pywbemcli tests to avoid hiding the default connection file and
the names for the connection file and mock cache by moving as part of tests.
EnvVar PYWBEMCLI_ALT_HOME_DIR defines alternate directory for connection file
and mockcache and is set for all pywbemcli tests. The definition of file
names for default connection file and mock cache managed by pywbemcli moved
from  pywbemtools/pywbemcli/_utils.py to pywbemcli/_connection_file_names.py.
