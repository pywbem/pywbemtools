# Temporary workarounds on indirectly used packages:

# The tornado package is used by ipykernel which is used by jupyter.
# Tornado 5.0.0 and 5.0.1 rejects installation if the Python ssl module
# does not have certain symbols required by Tornado. This issue exists for
# example with Python 2.7.6 on Ubuntu 14.04, but not with Python 2.7.5 on
# RHEL 7.4. This can be checked with:
#   python -c "import ssl; ssl.SSLContext; ssl.create_default_context; ssl.match_hostname"
# Other projects have the same issue:
#   https://github.com/floydhub/dl-docker/issues/84
# The following is a circumvention of this issue that nails the tornado
# version to below 5.0 on Python 2.
# TODO: Follow up on resolution of this issue.
