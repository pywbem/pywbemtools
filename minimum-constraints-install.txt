# Pip constraints file for install dependencies.
#
# This file specifies constraints that match the minimum versions specified in
# the requirement file for package installation (requirements.txt). They are
# used for example when setting up test environments with the minimum versions
# of any dependent packages. This includes base dependencies
# (pip+setuptools+wheel) that are needed for setting up a minimum version
# environment, but are not specified in requirements.txt.


# Base dependencies (must be consistent with base-requirements.txt)

pip==25.0; python_version == '3.8'
pip==25.2; python_version >= '3.9'
setuptools==70.0.0

# Direct dependencies for install (must be consistent with requirements.txt)

pywbem==1.8.0
# When using the GitHub master branch of pywbem, simply comment out the line
# above, since links are not allowed in constraint files - the minimum will be
# ensured by requirements.txt then.

nocaselist==1.0.3
nocasedict==1.0.1
# Safety package requires click 8.0.2 minimum
Click==8.0.2
click-spinner==0.1.8; python_version <= '3.11'

# TODO: The version specified in requirements.txt is a fork of
# click=repl. When that fork is integrated and a new version of click-repl
# is released that should be the new minimum because that fork changes the
# repl function interface by adding a new parameter that pywbemcli uses.
# Version 0.3.0 does not work for us because of issue #1441 so in requirements
# we are currently using a forked version of the click-repl master.
# Probably: click-repl==0.3.1
