# Pip constraints file for install dependencies.
#
# This file specifies constraints that match the minimum versions specified in
# the requirement file for package installation (requirements.txt). They are
# used for example when setting up test environments with the minimum versions
# of any dependent packages. This includes base dependencies
# (pip+setuptools+wheel) that are needed for setting up a minimum version
# environment, but are not specified in requirements.txt.


# Base dependencies (not in requirements.txt)

# * pip>=9.0.0 to support the --upgrade-strategy option
# * setuptools>=20.5 to support environment markers
# * pip 10.0.0 introduced the --exclude-editable option.
# * pip 18.0 is needed on pypy3 (py36) to support constraints like cffi!=1.11.3,>=1.8.
# * pip 20.0 introduced the --no-python-version-warning option
# * pip 20.2 introduced a new resolver whose backtracking had issues that were resolved only in 21.2.2.
# * pip>=21.0 is needed for the cryptography package on Windows on GitHub Actions.
