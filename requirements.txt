# Pip requirements file for pywbemtools runtime dependencies.

# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order

# Make sure that the package versions in minimum-constraints.txt are also

# Direct dependencies (except pip, setuptools, wheel):

pywbem>=1.6.0
# When using the GitHub master branch of pywbem, comment out the line above,
# activate the GitHub link based dependency below.
# In that case, some of the install tests need to be disabled by setting
# the 'PYWBEM_FROM_REPO' variable in in tests/install/test_install.sh.
