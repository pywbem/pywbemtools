    """
    A connection repository that contains the named connection definitions
    and provides methods to manage these connection definitions.

    The connection definitions are automatically persisted in a
    :term:`connections file`.

    This class loads the connections file in a lazy manner upon access by one
    of the methods that need it to be loaded. When modifications are made,
    the connections file is immediately written back, creating a backup file
    of the current connections file.

    Each connection definition is represented as a PywbemServer object.

    This class supports the dictionary interface for accessing the connection
    definitions, using the connection name as a key, and the PywbemServer object
    as a value. The dictionary interface supports a subset of read-only
    operations.

    The connections file is a YAML file, with a format as shown in the following
    example that defines a mock connection named 'mock1', a server connection
    named 'server1', and defines 'mock1' as the default connection. The
    properties of each connection definition are the attributes of PywbemServer
    objects:

        connection_definitions:
            mock1:
                name: mock1
