# Click issue #1231:
# On Windows, the Click package has the issue that it writes '\n' at the Python
# level as '\r\r\n' at the level of the Windows shell, and Popen() with
# universal_newlines=True does not handle this case.
# To circumvent that issue, pywbemtools specifies universal_newlines=False and
# performs the universal newline conversions itself (it does what Popen() does,
# and in addition replaces the incorrectly created '\r\r\n' sequence).
# That issue has been fixed in Click 7.1 on Python 3, but Click 7.1 has also
# removed support for Python 3.4 so pywbemtools now requires Click 7.1 with
# all Python versions except 3.4. It turns out that the circumvention is also
# needed on Python 2.7, even though Click 7.1 is used there (not clear why).
# The CLICK_ISSUE_1231 boolean indicates that the Click issue is present.

    Invoke a command as a child process.

    The command must be accessible in the PATH, i.e. installed in the current
    Python environment.

    Parameters:

      cmdname (string): Command name (e.g. pywbemcli). The command name may be
        a binary string encoded in UTF-8, or a unicode string.

      args (sequence of string): Command line arguments, starting with the first
        argument after the command name. Each single argument must be its own
        item in the sequence; combining the arguments into a string does not
        work. The arguments may be binary strings encoded in UTF-8, or unicode
        strings.

      env (dict or None): Environment variables to be put into the environment
        before executing the command. None means to not set any variables. Dict
        key is the variable name as a string; dict value is the variable value
        as a string (without any shell escaping needed), or None to unset the
        variable. The environment of the current process is saved and restored.

      stdin (string or None):
        Passed to the executable as stdin, if not None. Lines are separated
        with NL. May be binary a string encoded in UTF-8, or a unicode string.

      verbose (bool):
        Display args, env, and stdin before executing the command and rc,
        stdout, stderr afterwards.

      capture (bool):
        Capture stdout and stderr of the command. Not capturing that is useful
        when invoking the commands with the --pdb option that breaks in the
        built-in pdb debugger.

    Returns:

      tuple(rc, stdout, stderr): Output of the command, where:

        * rc (int): Exit code of the command.

        * stdout (unicode string): Standard output of the command. Lines are
          separated with NL. Empty string if there was no output. None if
          output was not captured.

        * stderr (unicode string): Standard error of the command. Lines are
          separated with NL. Empty string if there was no output. None if
          output was not captured.
