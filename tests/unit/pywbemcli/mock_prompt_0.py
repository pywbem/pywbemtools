    Python code to mock pywbemcli._common.pywbemcli_prompt. Returns the
    value defined in RETURN_VALUE

    This file was defined to mock the return from pywbemcli instance
    get/delete/... with the simple_assoc_mock_model and return "0" to represent
    the first entry in the displayed output.

    Add this file to the set of mock options and the prompt for picking
    the instance will be output but the prompt for a response from the
    user will be bypassed and the value defined in RETURN_VALUE returned.

    This file is enabled during testing through the PYWBEMCLI_STARTUP_SCRIPT
    environment variable.
