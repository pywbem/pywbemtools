pywbemcli mock script that calls the WBEMServerMock class in
tests/unit/pywbemcli/testmock and creates an instance of a WBEM server using the
default dictionary definition of the server defined in the same file as the
WBEMServerMock class.  This just separates the class from the script initiator
in pywbemcli so that other dictionary definitions of the mock can be created.

This script has the DMTF model itself as a dependent but we are not
registering the pieces of the model as a dependent because we don't really
know what changes in the model.
